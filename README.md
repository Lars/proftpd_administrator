# ProFTPd Administrator
PHP based ProFTPD management software for daily daemon maintenance chores.

## About 
This is a fork of chrizkoid's (the only nick I could find related to the
project) ProFTPd Administrator, a PHP based program to administer the daily
chores of managing a ProFTPd ftp daemon.

Originally found in http://proftpd-adm.sourceforge.net/index.php I include here
the original text from that page. Any new text I add to this README will be
included after the original content by chrizkoid.

From: http://proftpd-adm.sourceforge.net/page_about.php :

> A while back ago working to set up an easily administered ftp I found the
> shareware ftp-server Serv-U for Microsoft Windows(TM). All was great until the
> trial timed out effectively ending all the rejoycing (is this word spelled out
> correctly anyway?) - the time had come to either pay up or get creative. There's
> no question what became of that question since my Slackware-server was up and
> ready to go. 
>
> After considering the alternatives for GNU/Linux when it comes to more
> professional ftp-servers I ended up choosing proFTPd. Unfortunately as I was
> quick to discover was that this server was a nightmare to compile (atleast if
> you needed additional modules compiled in), configure and administer. The two
> first can be solved with a proper-quality tutorial, and the implementation for
> the last part is what you're looking at right now.
